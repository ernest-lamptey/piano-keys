# PIANO KEYS

This project is under DOM Events in Javascript. I found it pretty interesting that you could make a lot of changes to simple webpage.

Hope to learn about sounds so that I can map some sounds to each 'mousedown' event on those keys and see how the song plays. Maybe also add a library of other simple songs.
